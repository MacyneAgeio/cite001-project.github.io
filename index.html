                Much like the Earth, the Moon also composes similar attributes such as the core, mantle, and crust.
                <br><br>
                
                <h2>Crust:</h2> The moon's outermost layer, known as the crust, is between 20 and 40 miles (30 and 60 kilometers) thick. It is mostly composed of stony elements such as calcium, magnesium, oxygen, silicon, and aluminum. The lunar surface of the moon is then distinguised into two regions: <b>The Lunar Highlands</b>, which is the lighter areas of the moon. And <b>Maria</b>, The darker patches which were formed through ancient volcanic activity.
                <br><br>
 
                <h2>Mantle:</h2> The lunar mantle is located several hundred miles below the surface and is located under the crust. And it is composed of iron and silicates, among other denser rocks and likely contains minerals like olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar.
