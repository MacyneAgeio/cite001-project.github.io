          NASA on Thursday showcased a captivating image of the Crab Nebula, which lies 6,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Taurus.
          <i>"The remnant of a supernova is comprised of several different components, shown in different colors: doubly ionized sulfur (represented in red-orange), ionized iron (blue), 
          dust (yellow-white and green), and synchrotron emission (white), a type of electromagnetic radiation,"</i> the space agency explained. (Instagram/NASA)

          Researchers have discovered the most distant active supermassive black hole to date with the James Webb Space Telescope. The galaxy, CEERS 1019, existed just over 
          570 million years after the big bang, and its black hole is less massive than any other yet identified in the early universe. Not only that, they have easily “shaken out” 
          two more black holes that are also on the smaller side, and existed 1 and 1.1 billion years after the big bang. Webb also identified eleven galaxies that existed when the 
          universe was 470 to 675 million years old. The evidence was provided by Webb’s Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, led by Steven Finkelstein of the 
          University of Texas at Austin. The program combines Webb’s highly detailed near- and mid-infrared images and data known as spectra, all of which were used to make these 
          discoveries.
