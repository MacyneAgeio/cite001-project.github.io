              Mercury is the smallest planet in the universe and the first planet that is the closest to the Sun. 
              Mercury's surface is composed of 5 elements which are sodium, sulfur, potassium, chlorine and thorium. 
              It is a rocky planet that is rich of iron which makes up about 70% of Mercury's total weight. It only
              takes 88 days for Mercury to revolve around the Sun at an average speed of 105,947 miles 
              (170,505 kilometers) per hour, and is considered to be the fastest among the other planet in the Solar system.

              of other gases although it composed of mostly gases, Venus is a rocky planet that is made up of inner iron core and rocky 
              mantle. It only takes 225 days for Venus to revolve around the Sun at an average speed of 78,341 miles (126,077 kilometers)

              Earth is composed of a variety of elements. The Earth's crust has four main component, which are materials, rocks, soil and water that makes
              life on Earth possible. It takes 365 days for Earth to revolve around the Sun and 366 days during leap year that occurs every 4 years,

              water vapor. It also has a plenty mineral resources including iron, nickel, titanium, aluminum, sulfur, chlorine and calcium. It takes 687 days for Mars to

              Jupiter is the fifth and the largest planet in the Solar system more than twice as massive as all other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are 
              actually cold. It has a composition of hydrogen and helium whichk makes it a gas planet. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing 
              the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. It takes about 4,333 days 
              for Jupiter to revolve around the Sun at an average seped of 28,273 miles (43,000 kilometers) per hour.

              is rocky and its mantle is made up of icy water, methane and ammonia. Uranus is considered the coldest planet that holds the record of -224Â°c ever measured in
              the Solar system. It takes about 30,687 days for Uranus to revolve around the Sun with the speed of 15,290 (24,607 kilometers) per hour.
